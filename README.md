# SMS-SPAM-classifier
📩 SMS Spam Detection with Machine Learning A machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various classifiers. This notebook walks through the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
🔍 Features
Text preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming, vectorization)
Data visualization (word clouds, bar plots)
Model training using:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
User-friendly modular structure with clear explanations

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
NLP: NLTK, CountVectorizer
Visualization: Matplotlib, WordCloud, Seaborn

📊 Dataset
Uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🚀 How to Run
